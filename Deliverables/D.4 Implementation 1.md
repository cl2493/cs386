# D.4 Implementation 1

## 1. Introduction

RNT-A-ROOM is a housing web application that focuses on the needs of travel nurses. We offer comfort and safety on an easy-to-use platform that protects our users by verifying both tenants and rentals. Our system’s main features include a responsive homepage that loads within 3 seconds, a user profile that will display 5 user descriptions, user verification, and have the ability to book listings. 

Disclaimer: RNT-A-ROOM is in early development.

## 3. Tests
You should implement automated tests that aim to verify the correct behavior of your code. Provide the following information:

1.Test framework you used to develop your tests (e.g., JUnit, unittest, pytest, etc.)

1.Link to your GitHub folder where your automated unit tests are located
1.An example of a test case. Include in your answer a GitHub link to the class being tested and to the test
1.A print screen showing the result of the execution of the automated tests

Grading criteria (4 points): You should have an adequate number of automated tests. They should be well-written to exercise the main components of your system, covering the relevant inputs.

## 4. Adopted technologies
HTML/CSS/Javascript
**Description**:
These are the core structure of creating web pages and applications. HTML gives us the structure, CSS focusing on presentation and styles, and Javascript allows our website to be more dynamic.
Justification: 
These are fundamental in creating a website or a web application. They are applicable for all different web browsers.

PHP
Description: PHP is a scripting language often used for web development. It’s used mainly in web development to create dynamic websites and applications.
Justification: PHP is used to provide an open source and server side scripting in our website.

MySQL
Description: MySQL is a database management system. 
Justification: This helps us to store data in tables in our database. It is not a programming language, but is used to store data.

GitHub
Description:
Github was adopted as the team’s choice of version control software. Github provided our team with all the necessary tools to properly collaborate and maintain our project. Github allows for seamless VS code integration, allowing us to maintain our project in any manner, straight from our chosen coding environment.
Justification:
We selected github as our version control platform due to its simplicity and its wide adoption in the industry as well as third party app support. 

Heroku
Description:
Heroku is a cloud platform service that allows developers to deploy, manage, and scale their applications. They support multiple coding languages and provide built-in tools for continuous integration.
Justification:
We chose Heroku for their ease of use platform and their simple layout. Being familiar with Github pages, Heroku allowed us to seamlessly integrate our application on their cloud platform service.

VSCode
Description: VS code is a source-code editor. It allows developers to write code with a clean and simple UI. It has several features that make it a great candidate for our project. One feature is that it works well with git. You can easily stage, commit, and push your changes with clicking of buttons. You don’t have to spend precious time memorizing or writing commands. You can also create pull requests and see the issue tracker very easily.
Justification: We chose to use VS code because of how easy it is to use. It looks nice and works well. Also, we needed a code editor that works on everyone’s device. The added git features makes VS code the best choice for us. Because of how easy VS code is to use with git, we spend more time coding and developing than we memorizing and typing commands.

## 5. Learning/training
HTML/CSS/Javascript
Using our past experience in CS 212 and 312, we applied that our knowledge to this project to create our website.

PHP
The team employed the strategy of Youtube videos and online resources. We spent much of our time learning the syntax of the language.

MySQL
The team did research on these technologies beforehand and brought it upon themselves to experiment and see what worked for the benefit of the website. The perseverance of the team to implement technologies that we haven’t previously used before for trial and error is admirable.

GitHub
Our team utilized numerous online videos as well as the heavy in class assignments focusing on github and its many features.

Heroku
We reviewed videos and other online resources to understand how to implement their services for our application. We also talked to other students to understand how a cloud service platform works.

VSCode
We used both strategies of trial and error and past experiences to learn VS code. Online references were also helpful.

## 6. Deployment
https://rnt-a-room-db33fe3ae403.herokuapp.com/index.php

We push and commit changes on github and make sure there are no conflicts affecting the main branch, then we deploy RNT-A-ROOM on Heroku. Heroku is a cloud platform service and we are using it for our webhosting.

## 7. Licensing
Mit License : https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/
(License Application)[]
We chose the MIT license because it’s recognized for being simple and flexible. We want others to have access and allow them to do what they want to the code with minimal restrictions.


## 8. README File
You should also prepare your repository for receiving new contributors. You should prepare a README.md file. See an example at https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/109311bb0361f32d87a2Links to an external site.. In the README file, the current version should be stated. You should follow the Semantic VersioningLinks to an external site. schema. Tag the GitHub repository accordingly (see Git Basics TaggingLinks to an external site.). 

Your repository should contain a CONTRIBUTING.md file, a LICENSE file, and a CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md file. Search online for some examples of these files. In this section of the deliverable, put links to these files on GitHub.

Grading criteria (3 points): This section will be based on the presence and quality of the information presented in the files.

## 9. Look & feel
Describe the approach you adopted to design your user interface. Include some screenshots.

Grading criteria (3 points): This section will be graded based on the appearance (aesthetics) and usability (ease of use) of the system.

## 10. Lessons learned
In retrospective, describe what your team learned during this first release and what you are planning to change for the second release. 

Grading criteria (2 points): Adequate reflection about problems and solutions, clear description with adequate use of language. 

## 11. Demo
Include a link to a video showing the system working.

Grading criteria (6 points): This section will be graded based on the quality of the video and on the evidence that the features are running as expected. Additional criteria are the relevance of the demonstrated functionalities, the correctness of the functionalities, and the quality of the developed system from the external point of view (user interface).
