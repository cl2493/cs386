      Instructions:
      describe in one paragraph what your project is about. Make it clear what problem your software is solving and the context of the solution.

RNT-A-ROOM focuses on comfort and safety for our Travel Nurses. Housing options are tailored for them and their professions. With our security processing system, only allowing travel nurses access to our resources gives both landlords and travel nurses the ease of mind when working with one another. We strive to give high-quality housing selection services to make housing the last thing you need to work about during your travel to help heal our country. 


INITIAL VALUE PROPOSITION & CUSTOMER SEGMENT
---------------------------------------------
      Instructions: 
      report the initial guesses for the (i) value proposition and (ii) customer segment. The value proposition should make clear what your product is, the target customer, the value you provide, and why your product is unique. See examples on the lecture slides.
      GRADING CRITERIA (5 points): The value proposition should make clear the value from the point of view of the customer. It should not be a slogan or a description of functionality. The value proposition and consumer segment should be coherent with the text in the previous section---in particular, the value should address the problem reported above (problem-solution fit). The customer segment should not be too broad or too specific.

      - Landlord with 4 Rental Properties
      Key Insights from the Interview
      - Having Short Term Tenants are a hassle because you have to clean up after each tenant so often and finding another one is the hardest part. So when your property has no tenant, you make no money.
      Quotes
      -"Short-term tenants are tiring. I prefer people who can stay there for longer because for short term tenants I have to clean up after them so often"
      -"People who live short-term you need to charge them a lot more because you have to think about your time. Because you have to find people after they leave and that's losing money. You also need to clean up more often if you are constantly having short tenants"
      -"Finding new people to live in your rental properties is probably the only hard part."
      Assessment: Must Have/ Nice to Have/Don't Care (how the interviewee sees the solution)

      Customer Segment?
      - NP and Landlord
      Key Insights from the Interview
      -In planning your arrangements, you need to be on time. Put in consideration that you need a good housing place, cost, convenience of commuting to work, and the safety of the environment.
      -Flexible cancellation policy is a good thing to have as a policy, so you can have a limitation in time for cancellations and in that case you have to establish a time frame for refunds, as well as the amount.
      -Most travel nurses commute to their assignments by using their own car, there are many other options depending on where their assignment location is, if it's a rural area with not much public transportation, the best option is to take your car. 
      Quotes
      -"If I was a traveling nurse, I’d like not to get involved with cutting grass and take care of outside, just take care of my room/kitchen. If all the people that rent, let's say there are other nurses, they may decide to pay someone to do their cleaning for them. For me, I’d like the landlord or housing agent to take care of outside cleaning, not my room, “I can manage my room”."
      -"You may like things like gym, groceries,local hospitals and clinics, to be around the place without going too far. That's the convenience of housing."
      -"Are you someone that likes to share? Share the kitchen, cost of the housing, like electricity, water and stuff like that. Some people have the desire to have a small case: just get a room, for people who like privacy; they can rent an apartment for themselves."
      -"Depending on the agency you are working for, if they try to pay for housing for you and if it's cheaper, go for it. If you like convenience and privacy, you can consider all these factors like safety, commute time, facilities, safety yourself which is a part of planning or ask questions from your agency."
