4. Demo
Include a link to a video showing the system working.
Grading criteria (10 points): This section will be graded based on the quality of the video and on the evidence that the features are running as expected. Additional criteria are the relevance of the demonstrated functionalities, the correctness of the functionalities, and quality of the developed system from the external point of view (user interface).

5. Code quality
Our team implemented code smells by changing and refactoring the quality of our code. As seen in the commits on Github, we all have taken steps to make our code more modular. Creating separate files and putting code in them so that our bigger files that handle more aren‚Äôt as busy.
An example of this practice is in our ‚Äúupload certification‚Äù php file, the code follows the principle of moving statements to callers in some aspects.
Throughout our various files, we have different user types which makes our code more centralized and helps with code duplication.


Our team also implemented and practiced meaningful, distinctive names throughout our code. We intentionally utilized descriptive and revealing names for any code-related naming throughout this project. 
This can be observed through the meaningful distinctions present throughout the entire code base for example, in our ‚ÄúProperty Owner Profile‚Äù we make meaningful distinctions between each layer/abstraction of the profile to allow for easier identification and debugging.


Our team also furthered our coding practices by focusing heavily on well-documented and commented code. This was accomplished through the use of necessary comments throughout the entire code base to assist with any endeavors regarding that piece of code. All comments were created with a specific goal in mind to further readability and overall understanding. Whether this goal was to be informative of a function, or explanation of intent regarding a specific variable. 


Our team includes error handling in our files and this is good coding practice because we can see where issues lie in our code. The error handling being at the top of our files makes the code easier to understand and maintain. For example, in both user profiles, we handle file uploads and we implement the ‚ÄúReplace Error Code with Exception‚Äù practice because we have different cases for how the file upload can go wrong.






6. Lessons learned
During our process in this project, we wish we thought ahead and planned out more comments, and made our code more modular. We often ran into problems with readability and trying to understand each other's work. If we had more time to continue developing our project, we would focus on readability and scalability to ensure our success. Another issue we ran into was developing our website. Currently, our website has white spaces and we would like to fill it up with more details and information but as we are more focused on making sure our site contains that bare minimum, there was less room for creativity with the time crunch. Overall, we believe that if we had started sooner with everything we know now, we believe we could have produced a better, well-thought-out website.
