## Reflection:
During our user evaluation, there were a few features that worked properly. The registration and the user login worked for all of our users. Our directory with all of our listings all displayed properly but our filter system broke the website for some of our users. The certification did not cause any issues for any of our users according to what we saw in the database but there were no comments about it in the survey. Those testing our website had the opportunity to communicate with us about any issues they were having with the site and the main issue was the filters. After we worked on it further after the testing, the filters work no matter the location you input.
When conducting our user evaluations, we observed that certain aspects of the website were less intuitive than we had liked. This included certain buttons and UI elements behaving in buggy manners. Additionally, more access to the profile and additional statistics/information would have been nice. Finally, some reported encountering a temporary 404 page when utilizing the website. 
Overall, some users felt that it was pretty easy to navigate through while others felt like they needed a guide to navigate through the system. Cathy created a doc with instructions so that the user can experience the completed functionalities of the project. They were asked for example, how easy the website is. According to the collected data, the feedback they provided was that it could be “easier”. We noticed that everyone who participated in the survey signed up as a travel nurse. This shows that the people were lazy and did not fully test the functionalities of the website, that being the property owner portal.
When signing up, Faith’s roommate chose to sign up as a travel nurse. When uploading the certification, she encountered an error, “unable to upload file”, after doing it again, the certification worked. As far as reservations and bookings are concerned, the users were able to play around with the listings and ratings.
Users appreciated the top bar and the search bar the most. We were also complimented on how nice the design of the website looks. Lastly, users really enjoyed both the popup on the top right with all the pages that the user can access and the notification bell.
Our value proposition was accomplished. We did everything we set out to do. We made a website that allows verified travel nurses to safely and comfortably book housing options from verified property owners.
